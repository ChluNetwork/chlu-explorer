# Chlu Explorer

The Explorer is a full Chlu Service Node that runs entirely in the browser and
provides a user interface to explore Chlu content and see events as they are
happening in real time, while helping replicating the data.

# Hacking

The explorer is a react application created using create-react-app

- install dependencies with `yarn`
- start a development server using `yarn start`
- create a production build using `yarn build`

The Explorer is not ready for production use and creating a production build
has not been tested.
